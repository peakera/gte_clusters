Instructions 

There will be two sets of visuals included in this repository: Flora and Fauna. Each set contains an html file, a css stylesheet, and several json files of the original data. You can save these files anywhere on your machine, but you must keep all of the files in the same folder in order for the visuals to work.  To view the visuals, open the html file in your browser of choice. You may need to right click on the file and select the program (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) that you would like to use to open the file.

About these Visuals

These visuals attempt to contextualize both human characters and nonhuman others within the natural world of Mary Webbâ€™s 1917 novel Gone to Earth. The html combines 6 visualizations of the tag "fauna" that appears within 45 characters (the average length of a sentence in the novel) of another specified tag (e.g. Hazel, Edward, Reddin). Words may be repeated and have not been sorted in any particular way. The visualizations demonstrate that some human characters have more connections to the natural world than others and that the natural world comprises many living agents.
